# random
Some pseudo-random scripts.
Since I've got issues with the random module (surely because I still use python 2.7) I've decided to create by myself tools for pseudo-random values generation.
I'm of course open to suggestion in order to improve these little scripts.

The pseudo-generation is based on the current time and therefore not very complex so it definetely shouldn't be used for encryption purposes.
the module datetime is used in order to obtain the current time. I used the most dynamic part in order to have a variable the most... variable possible.
